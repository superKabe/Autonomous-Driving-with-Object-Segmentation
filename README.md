Repository for Autonomous Driving with Object Segmentation, a project engineered throughout the duration of my Masters in Electronic & Computer Engineering. 

## Installation
For the model, follow the README installation instructions in the FastSAM subfolder. 
For RasPi scripts, you'll need a Raspberry Pi, obviously. And a PiCam or webcam.
Clone the FastSAM repo from Ultralytics [directly](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/fast-sam/#fastsam-official-usage).
This project was built using Python 3.9.


## Usage
Most of the Python scripts are self contained, able to run when the appropriate interpreter is selected and all libraries installed. 

*Caution: It's far too easy to get stuck in dependency hell when installing this project's packages, you've been warned!!!*
